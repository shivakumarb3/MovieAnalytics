We often get bombarded on Facebook with commercials of those exact products we were browsing through on an e-commerce website, say an hour ago. We no longer need to search for the next episode of our favourite series on YouTube because it helps us continue from where we stopped. Delivery apps seem to gauge our food choices better than we ourselves do, and we are no longer surprised with these human-like qualities of our machines because data analytics is now a reality and has inarguably invaded almost every corner of our social life.

If you are social media savvy and have declared your undying love for a particular actor, your choice of a city or even a dress that you like, by all chances Facebook can hit you with the trailer of a movie of this actor, shot in your favourite city with the heroine wearing the kind of clothing that you prefer. Yes, that’s the power of data analytics that is helping filmmakers tweak the aesthetics of their films and reach out to a wider audience with similar taste.

         As data analytics is picking pace in film industries across India,<bold style="color:red"> one of the first films in Bollywood that used data analytics to its advantage was Rajkumar Rao’s Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana.</bold> Infinite Analytics Nucleus, a data analytics firm, studied the uniqueness of the movie, and more importantly, helped to identify its niche audience.
